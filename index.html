          The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with

				heir meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken
				production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are 
				typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional
				farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them
				outnumber humans more than two to one.The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the

      <p>Salmon /ˈsæmən/ is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same 
	  family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and 
	  Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great
	  Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.
        Typically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce.
		However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives.The term "salmon" comes from the 
		Latin salmo, which in turn might have originated from salire, meaning "to leap".

        Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salta variety of ingredients,
		such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.It is vinegared rice topped with other ingredients.
		Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
		It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types
		of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled
		daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally
 meat, and an optional serving of rice.Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi
